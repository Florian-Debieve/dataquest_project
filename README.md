# My Data Science projects
In this repositery, there is a collection of projects that I performed to train my skills in Data Science. Some of these projects were realized as part of the online courses that I took with www.dataquest.io, other came from www.kaggle.com and the rest are projects that I came up by myself.

Here is a suggestion of a few projects that can be interesting to look at:
